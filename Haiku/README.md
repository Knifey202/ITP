Haiku Assignment Documentation:
I started this process by simply following along with the commands you gave us in class last week. I kind of practiced by using the commands to move between all of the different folders in my directory, than going back, clearing it, etc. Once I felt like I could remember a little of what what did in class, I wrote the 'say -v "samantha" "I like to program, it is very challenging, but also quite fun" -o haiku.aiff' command chain to make my computer speak the haiku and save it to an unkown location. Immediately I started to troubleshoot where the file might have actually saved to. I was about to start going through my directory again when I saw the name of the terminal had now changed to 'cameronkuck - say -v samantha...'. I'm not sure when this change occured but as this is the name of of my user folder I could put together that the haiku probably saved into my 'cameronkuck' user folder. I did not run into many issues with this process nor did I seek out help/coding from AI or elsewhere. I will say I think the most difficult part of this process is remembering how to save files onto my Haiku github folder... Because I know this README.md file is saving changes but I cant find a way of double checking the contents of the Haiku folder itself.
