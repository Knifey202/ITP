##Values, Types, and Operators

Many things sounded familiar in this chapter but one thing I know for sure is that the code for ‘equal to’ is two = or ‘==‘ whereas the single ‘=‘ is for assigning values. I’m pretty sure we went over this in class hence my understanding.

One thing I truly didn’t know and found very interesting about code and computers in general was how fluent they are with math. I found it very interesting that, through using operators, you can input scientific notation and addition and multiplication and the computers natural response is to solve. It was mind blowing to me that PEMDAS is built into the knowledge of the computer despite the years it took me to learn it. I guess it all makes sense because all computers are is math.

##Program Structure

This chapter was all very new to me. I knew very little about how code was structured or how statements were organized. However the one thing that did sound familiar was how the computer reads code from top to bottom.

I was always kind of confused about the parameters in which code is permanent or only being used in the moment. The explanation of ‘environments’ helped me understand this more. Previously I didn’t know that a collection of binding being used in a certain time is called an environment. I feel I can better separate in my head the time frames of code being used.

##Functions

I truly knew little to none of the material in this chapter. The only thing I knew that was kind of proven or said was that Functions are extremely complicated and have multipe facets to them in order to make them do what you want them to.

Continuing on what I didn't know in the last chapter. Scopes within functions are really helping me understand when code is local or non viewable from outside the scope. Before reading this I was a little lost on how to separate when code was actively being used or not.
